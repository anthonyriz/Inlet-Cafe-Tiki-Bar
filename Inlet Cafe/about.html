    The Inlet Café is a second-generation family owned and operated restaurant.  <br>

    The Inlet Café was open in 1966 by our parents. Its original name was "The Lobster Pot". The name "Inlet Café"
    was chosen because back in 1966, there was talk of building an inlet into Sandy Hook, across from the restaurant.  
    The Inlet Café began as a local tavern with a small clam bar and four outdoor tables. The original building was 
    destroyed in 1975 by a catastrophic fire that started in a neighboring hotel. The Inlet Cafe was quickly rebuilt 
    and expanded into its present day form.

In 2012 we had to rebuild after hurricane Sandy.  During the storm we had 5 feet of water in the restaurant and 
renovations took until the spring to complete.  We are now back up and running better then ever.  Our 
commitment is clear, we make every effort to provide the finest quality food and absolute guest satisfaction.  We maintain extremely high standards for the products we purchase and strive to provide the freshest and best products available.
